## Tableau : Tableau is an excellent data visualization and business intelligence tool used for reporting and analyzing vast volumes of data. It helps users create different charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and stories for visualizing and analyzing data, to help in making business decisions. 

## I used Tableau Public, Tableau Public is free to use. They can be saved to Tableau's public cloud,  which anyone can access and view.  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/palkesh.bhidodiya/viz/Book1_16600651072630/Dashboard1?publish=yes
